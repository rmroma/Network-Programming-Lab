# C++ - Network Programming Lab - Messenger Project 

Hybrid P2P and clientserver messenger application that enable two clients to send and receive messages between one and the other.<p>
<b>The developed project will implement the following functionality:</b><p>

<dl>
  <dt>1. The project will include two apps: Messenger Server App (MSA) and Messenger Client App (MCA).</dt>
  <dt>2. The communication between the MCA and MSA will be TCP based (control messages).</dt>
  <dt>3. The communication between two MCAâ€™s will be UDP based (interaction between two clients).</dt>
  <dt>4. To connect to the server the client will sign in using a username and a password (encryption is not required).</dt>
  <dd>- The client can create a new user with a new password (unless this user is already created).</dd>
  <dd>- To communicate with another client, the user will request toopen a session with the required user name.</dd>
  <dd>- The list of usernames and passwords will be saved into a file in the server side.</dd>
  <dt>5. Chat rooms (conference chat):</dt>
  <dd>- The client is able to open a chat room.</dd>
  <dd>- Each client can enter a chat room or leave it.</dd>
  <dd>- Once a client enters a chat room it will receive all messages sent by all the other clients in the room.</dd>
  <dd>- In order not to overload the server, all client communication is P2P using UDP and does not pass through the server.</dd>
